## Development Tips & Notes

### Daily Routine Recommendations:
1. **Start each day** by reviewing previous day's work
2. **Plan specific goals** for each development session
3. **Test frequently** - don't let bugs accumulate
4. **Document as you go** - maintain code comments and design docs
5. **Version control** - commit working code daily

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Scope creep**: Stick to the plan, add features only after core completion
- **Technical debt**: Refactor regularly, don't rush through foundation phases
- **Burnout**: Take breaks, work sustainable hours
- **Feature complexity**: Start simple, add complexity gradually

### Milestone Checkpoints:
- **Day 35**: Basic village simulation working
- **Day 56**: Creature AI functional and learning
- **Day 77**: Magic system complete and balanced
- **Day 112**: All core systems integrated and polished
- **Day 140**: Campaign mode playable
- **Day 168**: Release-ready build

### Tools & Resources:
- **Unity Asset Store**: For additional art assets and tools
- **Blender**: For custom 3D modeling if needed
- **FMOD**: For advanced audio implementation
- **Git LFS**: For large asset version control
- **Unity Analytics**: For gameplay data collection
